    "Our philosophy, pure simplicity. GIVE US MONEY. Our products are shit, our return policy is non existing, we don't really give a shit about you but you will keep buying anyways cause that's your role in life, being a cow that we can milk and milk for all time. Even when we increase our prices some % cause our CEO has to pay more for his imported Venezuelan vegetables you'll still buy our stuff, you might complain on social media but who the fuck gives a shit? You aren't complaining here, all you are doing is filling servers in Luxemburg with you drivel, while our servers are in a third world country where we have bribed officials to get all the power so the local population suffer black outs on the regular while our servers keep running with the power of an entire city and all cause you people want to buy items made by underpaid workers, oh yeah our factory that makes these products are right next to our server farm and combined with our server farm they dump sludge in the water supply keeping the local population in perpetual medical debt forcing them to work for us.",
  ARTICLE_SECOND:
    "You see everything we do leads to something that benefits us while you keep doing things that don't. Can't you see why we came out on top while you keep oogling over this shit in hopes that your life gets marginally better if you buy it? And then you do and it didn't get better and now you're living in a trailer park due to crippling credit card debt and soon we are gonna put a server farm and factory where you live and put you to work, hike up your energy prices and make you sick from the pollution.",

  FAQ: {
    HEADER: "FAQ",
    Q_1: "You mentioned return policy in the above text? Can you elaborate?",
    A_1: "Yes, after a long and tiring fight in the courts we were forced to put a return policy in place but in interest in keeping prices up we hired a bunch of customer support workers in Finland, where the wages are really high. So if you ever request a return just know that all prices on our store go up 0.1%.",
    Q_2: "My credit card information was misused and I believe this site is the culprit!",
    A_2: "If you start getting mysterious charges in the middle of the night after buying something on this site then don't worry, it's our new state of the art AI system that buys things you definitely want after studying your personal information, cookies and GPS data. You might think 'I don't want more stuff from this site' and if you do you can opt out of data collection and AI prediction by sending a email and we'll remove you from the program, and start posting conspiracy theories about vaccines and the shape of the earth on your social media cause you obviously don't believe in science and we are giving you a head start on your new path in life of being excluded by your family and friends and being 'that' person in your hometown.",
    Q_3: "How long does delivery take?",
    A_3: "Delivery is dependent on your postal service, but on our end we have sped up delivery as much as we can. Our warehouse workers don't place stuff neatly in the back of the truck no, they throw that shit hard in the back of the truck.",
    Q_4: "Why isn't shipping costs shown?",
    A_4: "As any company we love hiding charges, months after you have gotten your product and it breaks cause it's not made to last you'll get a bill with shipping and tax and it'll be way higher than you expected. Why? To break your spirit but don't worry, you'll get a coupon too with a marginal discount but it'll be worded in such a way that you think it's worth way more than it is.",
    Q_5: "I have really bad first world guilt, is this company green?",
    A_5: "Yes*",
    A_5_SPAN:
      "Our factories spew out pollution and goods we get from third party companies are the cheapest option so we are pretty sure it's the same story there, do you really care though? It doesn't affect you, yet...",
